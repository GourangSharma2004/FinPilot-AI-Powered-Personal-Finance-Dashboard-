FinPilot 💸

FinPilot is an AI-powered personal finance dashboard designed to help users manage, understand, and optimize their financial life from a single platform.

Instead of just tracking money, FinPilot focuses on turning financial data into actionable insights through intelligent assistance.

Documents

Banking activity

with an added layer of AI-driven decision support.
